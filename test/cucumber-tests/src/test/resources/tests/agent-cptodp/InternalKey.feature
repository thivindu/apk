# Feature: Testing the internal-key generation and invocation
#   Background:
#     Given The system is ready
#   Scenario: Creating and invoking a REST API using Internal-Key
#     And I have a DCR application
#     And I have a valid Publisher access token
#     When I use the Payload file "artifacts/payloads/api1.json"
#     And I use the OAS URL "https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json"
#     And make the import API Creation request using OAS "URL"
#     Then the response status code should be 201
#     And the response body should contain "SwaggerPetstore"
#     And make the API Revision Deployment request
#     Then the response status code should be 201
#     Then I wait for 40 seconds
#     And make the Change Lifecycle request
#     Then the response status code should be 200
#     Then I make an internal key generation request
#     Then the response status code should be 200
#     And the response body should contain "apikey"
#     Then I set headers
#         | Internal-Key  | ${internalKey} |
#     And I send "GET" request to "https://default.gw.wso2.com:9095/petstore/1.0.0/pet/4" with body ""
#     And I eventually receive 200 response code, not accepting
#       |429|
  
#   Scenario: Undeploying an already existing REST API
#     And I have a DCR application
#     And I have a valid Publisher access token
#     Then I find the apiUUID of the API created with the name "SwaggerPetstore"
#     Then I undeploy the selected API
#     Then the response status code should be 200
#     And I send "GET" request to "https://default.gw.wso2.com:9095/petstore/1.0.0/pet/4" with body ""
#     And I eventually receive 404 response code, not accepting
#       |200|

#   Scenario: Testing Internal Key for GraphQL API
#     And I have a DCR application
#     And I have a valid Publisher access token
#     When the definition file "artifacts/definitions/schema_graphql.graphql"
#     When I use the Payload file "artifacts/payloads/gqlPayload.json"
#     Then I make the import GraphQLAPI Creation request
#     Then the response status code should be 201
#     And the response body should contain "StarwarsAPI"
#     And make the API Revision Deployment request
#     Then the response status code should be 201
#     Then I wait for 40 seconds
#     And make the Change Lifecycle request
#     Then the response status code should be 200  
#     Then I make an internal key generation request
#     Then the response status code should be 200
#     And the response body should contain "apikey"
#     Then I set headers
#         | Internal-Key  | ${internalKey} |
#     And I send "POST" request to "https://default.gw.wso2.com:9095/graphql/3.14" with body "{\"query\":\"{ hero { name } }\"}"
#     And I eventually receive 200 response code, not accepting
#       | 404 |
#       | 401 |
