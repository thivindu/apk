# Feature: API Deploying in DP to CP Flow
#   Scenario: Deploy a REST API to APK DP and invoke it using APIM Devportal
#     Given The system is ready
#     And I have a valid subscription
#     When I use the apk conf file "artifacts/apk-confs/endpoint_conf.yaml" in resources
#     And I use the definition file "artifacts/definitions/employees_api.json"
#     Then I generate and apply the K8Artifacts belongs to that API
#     Then I wait for 40 seconds  
#     And I have a DCR application
#     And I have a valid Publisher access token
#     Then I find the apiUUID of the API created with the name "APIResourceEndpoint"
#     Then the response status code should be 200
#     And the response body should contain "APIResourceEndpoint"
#     And make the Change Lifecycle request
#     Then the response status code should be 200
#     And I have a valid Devportal access token
#     And make the Application Creation request with the name "SampleApp"
#     Then the response status code should be 201
#     And the response body should contain "SampleApp"
#     And I have a KeyManager
#     And make the Generate Keys request
#     Then the response status code should be 200
#     And the response body should contain "consumerKey"
#     And the response body should contain "consumerSecret"
#     And make the Subscription request
#     Then the response status code should be 201
#     And the response body should contain "Unlimited"
#     And I get "production" oauth keys for application
#     Then the response status code should be 200
#     And make the Access Token Generation request for "production"
#     Then the response status code should be 200
#     And the response body should contain "accessToken"
#     Then I set headers
#       |Authorization|Bearer ${accessToken}|
#     And I send "GET" request to "https://carbon.super.gw.wso2.com:9095/endpoint/3.14/employee" with body ""
#     And I eventually receive 200 response code, not accepting
#       |429|
#     And the response body should contain "https://backend/anything/employee"
#     And I send "POST" request to "https://carbon.super.gw.wso2.com:9095/endpoint/3.14/employee" with body ""
#     And I eventually receive 200 response code, not accepting
#       |429|
#     And the response body should contain "https://backend/anything/test/employee"


#   Scenario Outline: Undeploy API
#     Given The system is ready
#     And I have a valid subscription
#     When I undeploy the API whose ID is "<apiID>"
#     Then the response status code should be <expectedStatusCode>
#     And I have a DCR application
#     And I have a valid Devportal access token
#     Then I delete the application "SampleApp" from devportal
#     Then the response status code should be 200
#     And I have a valid Publisher access token
#     Then I find the apiUUID of the API created with the name "APIResourceEndpoint"
#     Then I undeploy the selected API
#     Then the response status code should be 200

#     Examples:
#       | apiID                 | expectedStatusCode  |
#       | endpoint-test          | 202                 |
